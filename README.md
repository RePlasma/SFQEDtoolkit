SFQEDtoolkit: a high-performance library for the accurate modeling of strong-field QED processes in PIC and Monte Carlo codes . Peer-reviewed paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001046552300200X?via%3Dihub , pre-print: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07684, code: https://github.com/QuantumPlasma/SFQEDtoolkit

In this notebook we show how the Chebyshev polynomial fits of the nonlinear Compton Scattering and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler total cross-sections are implemented, reproducing figures 1 and 2 from the mentioned paper.
